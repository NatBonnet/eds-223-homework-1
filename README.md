This repository contains analyses and map outputs from EJScreen data. EJScreen provides information on on environmental and demographic information for the United States at the Census [tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_tract) and [block group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Census_block_group) levels. Respiratory Hazard Index data were selected from Hawaii and Puerto Rico to visualize potential health hazard disparities across average income levels and in U.S land areas with statehood vs. without.
